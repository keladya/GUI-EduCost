# Method for Optimizing Educational Costs and Career Prospects for Each Program at UI for Prospective Students

## Description
This project aims to optimize the information regarding educational costs and career prospects for each study program at the University of Indonesia (UI) for prospective students. By using a relational database and implementing SQL, this project presents the information systematically and can be easily accessed through a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Python and Tkinter.

## Key Features
- **Study Program Search**: Allows users to search for study program information at UI based on keywords.
- **Educational Cost Search**: Displays the educational costs based on study programs and education levels.
- **Faculty and Cluster Display**: Provides information about the faculties and education clusters at UI.
- **Career Prospects**: Displays career prospects related to the chosen study program.

## Database Structure
- **Educational Program**: Stores information regarding available educational programs (S1, D3, D4).
- **Cluster**: Stores data on the educational clusters at UI (e.g., Health Sciences, Social Sciences).
- **Educational Costs**: Information about educational cost categories per semester.
- **Faculty**: Data about the available faculties at UI, including the highest and lowest tuition fees.
- **Study Program**: Details about the study programs offered at UI.
- **Career Prospects**: Provides information on career prospects for graduates from specific study programs.

## Implementation
### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used to develop this application.
- **Tkinter**: Used to build the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SQL**: Used for managing and manipulating data within the relational database.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Design**: Using ERD to design relevant tables.
2. **SQL Implementation**: Using SQL commands to create tables, insert data, and perform query searches.
3. **GUI Development**: Building a user interface with Tkinter that allows users to interact with the system.
4. **Testing**: Testing various features of the application to ensure functionality and stability.
